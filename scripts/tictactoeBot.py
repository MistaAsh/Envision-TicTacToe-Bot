Tic Tac Toe Player Game

A game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments 
of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines
and each tries to get a row of three X's or three O's before the opponent does.
Implemented using Artificial Intelligence based on Minimax algorithm.
